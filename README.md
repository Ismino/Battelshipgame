Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

---

Happy coding!


# BATTELSHIP GAME

- The site is built for the user to play a type of battelship game. The game involves the user sinking the ships that are placed on the board. If the user succeeds in sinking all the ships, the user wins. The user has 15 round's until the game ends automatically.

- Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) 

- Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

## User Experience (UX)

- From a design perspectiv the site is not so nice to look at beacuse its only build with python and no CSS or designing. But the overall user experience when people play the game they are happy. Its a fun game to play.
- The user's whu tested the game was happy about it.
- The game is built easy for the user's to understand and has simple commands to follow.

## Design

- The app is only built with a back end langue as python and has no color design or special font design. It's just a simple back end app.

## Features

[amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

### Future Implementations

- In the future I want to make the game a bit more advanced like the user to play against the computer so they can se 2 boards. Maybe with more user messeges. 

### Accessibility

- I used simple commands for the user to simple understand the game. I built it and put it up for making it easy to understand.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- I used Python3 only.
